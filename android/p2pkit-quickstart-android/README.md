# p2pkit.io Android Quickstart

#### A peer-to-peer proximity SDK for iOS and Android

p2pkit is an easy to use SDK that bundles together several proximity technologies kung-fu style! With p2pkit apps immediately understand their proximity to nearby devices and users, 'verify' their identity, and exchange information with them.

[Create p2pkit account](http://p2pkit.io/signup.html)

2. Once you have an account you can log-in to the console and create an application key: [Create your Application Key](https://p2pkit-console.uepaa.ch/login)

> **Note:** p2pkit validates package names so don't forget to add ``ch.uepaa.quickstart`` to the known package names when creating your application key

3. Head to the ``MainActivity.java`` file and replace ``<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>`` with your new key:

  ```
  private static final String APP_KEY = "<YOUR PERSONAL APP KEY>";
  ```
